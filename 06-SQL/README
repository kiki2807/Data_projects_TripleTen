# 🚕 Chicago Taxi Data Analysis

This project explores ride activity and performance of taxi companies in Chicago. Using SQL-based data analysis, it evaluates company market share, neighborhood demand, and key patterns in ride distribution.

## 📝 Project Description

The goal of this project was to uncover insights from a dataset containing taxi rides in Chicago. After importing and cleaning the data, we examined:

- Company performance based on total trips
- Neighborhoods with the highest ride volume
- Average ride trends per company
- Hypothesis testing around ride distribution

This analysis helped identify top-performing taxi providers and high-demand areas, with a focus on actionable insights for business strategy.

## 🔍 Key Findings

- **Flash Cab** leads significantly in total rides, followed by **Taxi Affiliation Services**.
- **Downtown neighborhoods**—Loop and River North—consistently have the highest demand.
- Data was clean with no duplicates or nulls, and minimal preprocessing was required.
- Converting float values to integers improved readability in summary tables.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **SQL** (via PostgreSQL-style queries)
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Jupyter Notebook**
