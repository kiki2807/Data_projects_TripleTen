# 🚖 Taxi Demand Forecasting

This project focuses on building predictive models to forecast hourly taxi demand in a major city. By analyzing time series data and applying machine learning models, the goal is to help optimize driver dispatching and improve customer wait times.

## 📝 Project Description

Accurately forecasting taxi demand helps ride-hailing companies align driver supply with passenger needs. In this project, we use historical trip data to train models that predict the number of ride orders for future hours.

The notebook includes:
- Data preprocessing and timestamp parsing
- Feature engineering (lag features, rolling averages, and day-of-week indicators)
- Model training and evaluation using multiple approaches
- Final performance comparison on a holdout test set

## 🔍 Key Findings

- **LightGBM** consistently delivered the best balance between performance and speed.
- Including **lag features (1h, 24h)** and **rolling means (1h, 6h, 24h)** significantly boosted predictive accuracy.
- Time-based cross-validation helped avoid data leakage and overfitting.
- Model tuning and proper validation set usage were critical for real-world reliability.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: pandas, NumPy, datetime
- **Feature Engineering**: lag features, rolling averages
- **Machine Learning**: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, LightGBM
- **Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn
